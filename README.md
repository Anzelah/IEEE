To create a Node.js API backend. When the farmer submits their input (e.g., soil color, previous yield, etc.), the server will call this Python function (via a subprocess or HTTP request to a Python microservice), and the fertilizer recommendation will be sent back to the farmer.

Will use OFRA database in addition to the soilgrids data. OFRA dataset provides fertilizer recommendation based on specific region, experiment results, expected yield, and fertilizer application rates per acer. Use this data to train our model using RandomForest; then the ofra-trained model will acurately predict fertilizer recommendation when a farmer does input their location only(when using the app). This is where soilgrids api comes in. It fetches soil data like ph and specific nutrients; then the model trained with expert-tested(thus high quality) can accurately predict fertilizer recommendation + application per area.
Our model learns from ofra data, then uses soilgrids data to make personalized predictions even for farmers far from an ofra trial site. Ofra is the training data.

Might not need the farmer to provide texture and color(color is mainly used to determine organic matter; and we're already pulling this from soilgrids). Howerver, we might just use it to reference or test for accuracy; but its not necessary. The farmers crop history, combined with drainage(which can be deduced from texture), is absolutely necessary. Soil color is 50 50.
